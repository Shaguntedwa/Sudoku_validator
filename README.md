# 🧠 Sudoku Validator | Python + NumPy Project

Welcome to **Sudoku Validator** — a clean, logical, beginner-friendly Python project built using NumPy!

This is **Level 2** of my learning journey:  
✅ Understand NumPy deeply  
✅ Implement validation logic  
✅ Add user input + error reporting  
✅ Push clean code to GitHub  
✅ Build real-world logic confidence 💪

## 🔍 What It Does

This script checks if a 9x9 Sudoku grid is **valid**, meaning:
- Each **row** has all digits 1 to 9 without duplicates
- Each **column** has all digits 1 to 9 without duplicates
- Each **3x3 subgrid** has all digits 1 to 9 without duplicates

It also:
- Lets users input their own Sudoku grid
- Reports **which row/column/box is invalid** for full clarity
- Can be extended with GUI or error highlighting

## 🚀 How To Run
